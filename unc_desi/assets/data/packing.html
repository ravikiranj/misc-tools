<h1>Packing Checklist and Info</h1>
<h2>Complete Checklist</h2>
<div><p>We would like to acknowledge the fact that most of the below items were already listed at <a href="http://clubs.ncsu.edu/maitri/checklist.htm" target="_blank">NCSU's MAITRI</a> and we have modified the same to best suit UNC Grad Students. So, a big thank you to the folks at NCSU's MAITRI ;) !

<h2>Packing Advice</h2>
<ul class="notelist">
    <li>Start your packing well in advance.</li>
    <li>Buy two good suitcases - they should be able to withstand a lot of mishandling. They should be as large as possible within the size limitations and weight limitations. Please check with the airlines for baggage related information.</li>
    <li>Put identification marks and labels on both the inside &amp; outside the suitcases apart from this, the airlines will also provide you with labels.</li>
    <li>Do not lock your suitcases while coming here (unless you have TSA approved locks). They will be broken open during the customs check when you enter the US. It might be useful to tie a rope around the suitcases so that they do not split open in transit.</li>
    <li>Some airlines give students the option of carrying a third piece of check in luggage. The catch here is that unless you directly land at your destination, you will end up paying close to $50 as excess baggage fee on the connecting domestic flight, since most domestic airlines allow only 2 pieces of luggage for international travelers. Find out if this is the case before you start packing.</li>

<h2>Clothing</h2>
<div><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The Clothing list mentioned below may vary according to the individual preferences. In US, usually we do the laundry twice a month. So make sure that you get sufficient cloths that would last for at least 15 days.</p></div>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Carry all documentation safely, and have photocopies to back you up - letter from University, mark sheets etc. (the visa stuff basically). Things to get photocopied: Make two sets of the following, keep one set at home and bring the other set with you.</p>
<ul class="notelist">
    <li>Visa</li>
    <li>Xth, Inter (XIIth, 10+2), Degree marks sheets, Convocation Certificate of Under graduation (laminated in plastic preferably)</li>
    <li>I-20 and acceptance letter from the university.</li>
    <li>Take all the I-20's with you if you have more than one.</li>
    <li>A couple of passport sized photos (only with US size specifications- 2inch X2inch)</li>
    <li>Medical and Immunization history</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep the passport, I-20, all the certificates, mark sheets (your folder), medical records etc. in your handbag. Very rarely airlines misplace your luggage. Of course they refund you for the same but as you can see, some documents are too important for any refund.</p>

<p>You will complete your customs formalities at your first port of entry. ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME (at least 3 hours, considering the queue) BETWEEN YOUR FLIGHTS AT THAT AIRPORT.</p>

 
<h2>Things NOT to get along...!</h2>

<ul class="notelist">
    <li>Electrical appliances, unless you are sure it works here (i.e. you have a AC/DC converter). The electric supply here is 110V, 60Hz. Mostly all the electronic items are very cheap in US. So you can always get them here.</li>
    <li>Paper. There's lots of paper in the United States!</li>
    <li>There is no need to buy a new pair of sport shoes from India as you get them quite cheap out her. At least the unbranded ones which last real good. Also the branded ones like Nike, Adidas, Reebok can range anywhere from $25 to $75 and you get regular sales here on them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't worry yourself if you can't bring any of the stuff listed above - most of the items are available in the US. You will be able to get anything you want here. The primary reason for carrying the aforementioned items is because of the mental block of spending in dollars which everyone experiences on their first trip here. </p>
